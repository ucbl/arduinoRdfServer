		Decisions taken to work using CoAP on top of UDP instead of traditional HTTP/TCP
		Only partial implementation aimed for 2KB ram server Endpoint (piggybacked responses and buffer recycling)
		Once done, develop, test and integrate an HTTP/CoAP proxy
		Further work on a fully integrated service for the AsaWoo Platform
